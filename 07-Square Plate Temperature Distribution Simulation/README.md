## Project Overview

This simulation models the steady-state temperature distribution on a square plate with fixed edge temperatures. It involves generating a system of linear equations based on node densities and solving them to find the temperature at each node within the plate.

## Features

- **System of Linear Equations:** Generates a large system of linear equations based on the specified node density across the plate.

- **Numerical Solver:** Utilizes numerical methods to solve the system of linear equations for the temperature values.

- **Graphical Visualization:** Presents the temperature distribution as a graph, providing visual insight into the thermal characteristics of the plate.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for plotting the temperature distribution)
- SciPy (optional, for advanced numerical solvers)

You can install these with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```
**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/07-Square%20Plate%20Temperature%20Distribution%20Simulation.git

```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Square-Plate-Temperature-Distribution

```

**Running the Simulation:**
Execute the Python script to start the simulation:

```bash
python main.py

```
Follow any on-screen prompts to adjust simulation parameters if needed.
## Usage
- After running the script, the temperature distribution will be displayed as a graph. You can modify the edge temperatures and node density in the script to observe how different conditions affect the thermal distribution.
