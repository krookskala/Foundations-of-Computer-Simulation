## Project Overview

The simulation models the dynamic behavior of a mathematical pendulum, characterized by its angle and angular velocity, by solving differential equations using advanced numerical methods. It also provides an analysis of the pendulum's energy transformations over time.

## Features

- **Advanced Numerical Methods** Utilizes the improved Euler method and the RK4 method to solve the pendulum's motion equations.

- **Energy Analysis:** Calculates and displays graphs for potential, kinetic, and total energy of the pendulum, allowing for energy conservation analysis.

- **Excel-Based Simulation:** Implements the simulation within an Excel spreadsheet for easy manipulation and visualization.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application installed on your machine to open and interact with the Excel file.

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Excel file from the repository:**
- Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/03-Projectile%20Pendulum%20Motion%20Simulation].
- Find the Excel file and download it to your local machine.

**Running the Simulation:**
To start the simulation:

- Open the downloaded Excel file.
- Enable macros if prompted, as the spreadsheet may contain scripts for running the simulation.
- Follow the instructions within the spreadsheet to input initial conditions and run the simulations using both numerical methods.

## Usage
- Adjust simulation parameters and initial conditions directly within the Excel sheet to explore different scenarios. The spreadsheet will automatically update and display the results, including energy graphs.
