## About the Project

This simulation uses the Taylor (or Maclaurin) series to approximate sin(ùë•), demonstrating how a mathematical series can be utilized to compute trigonometric functions.

## Features

- **Taylor Series Approximation:** Calculates sin‚Å°(ùë•)using its Taylor series expansion.

- **Error Analysis:** Compares the approximation to Python's built-in math.sin function to assess accuracy.



## Getting Started

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from python.org

- **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Taylor-Series-Simulation.git

   ```

- **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Taylor-Series-Simulation

    ```

- **Running the Simulation:**
  Execute the script by running.
    ```sh
    python Main.py

    ```
  Follow the on-screen prompts to input the angle ùë• for which you want to compute sin(ùë•).



## Usage
- Input any angle ùë• (in radians), and the program will output the computed value using the Taylor series, the actual value using math.sin.
