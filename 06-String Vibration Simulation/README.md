## Project Overview

The simulation models the dynamic behavior of a vibrating string fixed at both ends, described by the wave equation. The simulation employs a discretized approach to solve for the string's displacement over time at specified points along its length.

## Features

- **Wave Equation Modeling:** Uses the wave equation to simulate the vibration of a string.

- **Energy Calculations:** Computes and graphs the kinetic, potential, and total energy of the string at each point in time.

- **Excel-Based Calculation and Visualization** Facilitates interaction with the simulation and visualization of results directly within Excel.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application installed on your machine to open and interact with the Excel file.

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Excel file from the repository:**
- Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/06-String%20Vibration%20Simulation].
- Find the Excel file and download it to your local machine.

**Running the Simulation:**
To start the simulation:

- Open the downloaded Excel file.
- Enable macros if prompted, as the spreadsheet may contain scripts for running the simulation.
- Follow the instructions within the spreadsheet to input initial conditions and execute the simulation.

## Usage
- Modify the string parameters and initial conditions directly within the Excel sheet to explore how different conditions affect the vibration patterns. The simulation outputs will update accordingly, showing the kinetic, potential, and total energies of the string.
