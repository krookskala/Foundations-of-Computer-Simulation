## Project Overview

This simulation involves solving given differential equations and visualizing the solutions to compare the performance of three numerical methods: Euler, Midpoint, and RK4. It offers insights into the applicability and effectiveness of each method under various scenarios.

## Features

- **Numerical Solutions** Utilizes three different numerical methods to solve differential equations.

- **Excel-Based Implementation:** The calculations and graphical visualizations are conducted within an Excel environment, allowing for easy manipulation and real-time data visualization.

- **Comparative Analysis** Provides plots that compare the results of the Euler, Midpoint, and RK4 methods, aiding in understanding their differences.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application installed on your machine to open and interact with the Excel file.

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Excel file from the repository:**
- Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/08-Differential%20Equations%20Solver%20and%20Visualization].
- Find the Excel file and download it to your local machine.

**Running the Simulation:**
To start the simulation:

- Open the downloaded Excel file.
- Enable macros if prompted, as the spreadsheet may contain scripts for running the simulation.
- Follow the instructions within the spreadsheet to run simulations using Euler, Midpoint, and RK4 methods.
## Usage
- Modify parameters directly within the Excel sheet to explore how changes affect the solutions of the differential equations. The spreadsheet will automatically update the graphs to reflect new results.
