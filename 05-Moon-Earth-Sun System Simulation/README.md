## Project Overview

This simulation provides a visual and numerical analysis of the moon's trajectory relative to the Earth and Sun. It is based on the assumptions of circular orbits and uses known celestial constants to calculate the positions of these celestial bodies over time.

## Features

- **Celestial Dynamics Modeling:** Simulates the moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

- **Numerical Integration:** Uses the improved Euler method (MidPoint) to solve the equations of motion, ensuring precision in trajectory predictions.

- **Excel-Based Simulation:** Enables easy interaction and real-time visualization of the celestial system within an Excel framework.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application installed on your machine to open and interact with the Excel file.

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Excel file from the repository:**
- Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/05-Moon-Earth-Sun%20System%20Simulation].
- Find the Excel file and download it to your local machine.

**Running the Simulation:**
To start the simulation:

- Open the downloaded Excel file.
- Enable macros if prompted, as the spreadsheet may contain scripts for running the simulation.
- Input the initial conditions and parameters like the angle of inclination, mass, radius, and moment of inertia as directed within the spreadsheet.
- Run the simulation by recalculating the spreadsheet or triggering specific macros that execute the calculations.

## Usage
- Modify the simulation parameters directly within the Excel sheet to explore how different angles of inclination, object properties (like mass and radius), and environmental conditions affect the motion. The results are dynamically updated and displayed within the spreadsheet.
