This project simulates the growth of a fractal plant using an L-system, a formal grammar primarily used to model the growth processes of plant development. The Python implementation generates graphical representations of the fractal plant based on defined rules and parameters.

## Project Overview

The L-system used in this simulation involves a set of symbols and production rules to model the iterative growth of a fractal plant. The system starts with an initial "word" and iteratively replaces parts of that word according to the production rules to simulate plant growth visually.



## Features

- **L-System Grammar:** Utilizes an L-system with specific symbols and rules to generate plant growth patterns.

- **Graphical Output:** Visualizes the growth of the fractal plant as a series of lines and curves based on the L-system rules.

- **Interactive Parameters:** Allows users to adjust the number of iterations to see different stages of plant growth.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

You will need Python installed on your machine, along with the necessary libraries for graphical output, typically matplotlib or turtle. If you do not have these libraries installed, you can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib

```

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/10-Fractal%20Plant%20Simulation

```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Fractal Plant Simulation

```
**Running the Simulation:**
Execute the main script to start the simulation:

```bash
python main.py

```
The script will prompt you to enter the number of iterations for generating the plant. Based on your input, the fractal plant will be displayed graphically.
## Usage
- After starting the script, you will be asked to input the number of iterations (n). The output will be a graphical representation of the fractal plant after n iterations of growth based on the L-system rules. You can rerun the script with different numbers of iterations to explore various growth patterns.
