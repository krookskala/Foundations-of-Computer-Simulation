## Project Overview

The simulation models the motion of a projectile influenced by gravity and a resistance force proportional to its velocity. It incorporates both Euler's method and the Midpoint method for numerical integration to predict the trajectory of the projectile, all implemented within an Excel spreadsheet.

## Features

- **Realistic Motion Modeling:** Considers both gravitational and drag forces to simulate projectile motion accurately.

- **Numerical Solutions:** Implements Euler's method and the improved Euler's method (Midpoint method) directly in an Excel spreadsheet for easy visualization and manipulation of data.

- **Parameter Customization:** Allows users to adjust physical parameters like mass, drag coefficient, and initial conditions through spreadsheet cells to observe different motion behaviors.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application installed on your machine to open and interact with the Excel file.

**Installation:**

1. **Download the Excel file from the repository:**
- Navigate to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation.git].
- Find the Excel file and download it to your local machine.

**Running the Simulation:**
To start the simulation:

- Open the downloaded Excel file.
- Enable macros if prompted, as the spreadsheet may contain scripts for running the simulation.
- Input initial conditions such as the initial velocity, angle of projection, and parameters like mass and drag coefficient directly into the designated cells.
- Run the simulation by following the instructions provided within the spreadsheet, which typically involve recalculating the sheet or triggering specific macros.

## Usage
- Adjust the simulation parameters directly within the Excel sheet to explore different scenarios. The spreadsheet will automatically update the trajectory calculations and display the results, which might include graphs or other visual outputs.
