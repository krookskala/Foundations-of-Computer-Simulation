# Foundations of Computer Simulation

Welcome to the Foundations of Computer Simulation repository! This collection of projects explores various computational models and simulations across different fields, from physical systems and biological processes to automata and fractal generation. Each project is designed to provide insights into the modeling and numerical analysis techniques used in computer simulation.

# Projects Overview

This repository contains the following projects:

- **Taylor Series Simulation:** Compute sine values using Taylor series approximations.
- **Projectile Motion Simulation:** Model the trajectory of projectiles under gravity and air resistance.
- **Mathematical Pendulum Simulation:** Simulate pendulum motion using numerical methods.
- **Inclined Plane Rolling Objects Simulation:** Analyze the dynamics of objects rolling down an inclined plane.
- **Moon-Earth-Sun System Simulation:** Visualize the trajectories of the Moon around the Earth and the Earth around the Sun.
- **String Vibration Simulation:** Explore the vibration of a string fixed at both ends using wave equations.
- **Square Plate Temperature Distribution:** Model temperature distribution on a square plate using differential equations.
- **Differential Equations Solver and Visualization:** Solve differential equations using various numerical methods and visualize the results.
- **Game of Life Simulation:** Implement Conway's Game of Life on a finite grid with customizable rules.
- **Fractal Plant Growth Simulation:** Generate fractal plant growth patterns using an L-system.
