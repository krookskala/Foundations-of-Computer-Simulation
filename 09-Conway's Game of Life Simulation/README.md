This project is an implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway. The simulation is built in Python and features a finite grid with cyclic boundary conditions and the capability for users to change rules during the game.

## Project Overview

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, where its evolution is determined by its initial state and requires no further input once it is running. Users can interact by setting up initial configurations and altering the rules of cell survival and reproduction as the game progresses.

## Features

- **Customizable Rules:** Users can change the rules that determine how cells survive, die, or reproduce during the simulation.

- **Cyclic Boundary Conditions:** Implements boundaries that wrap around, creating a continuous grid effect.

- **Python Implementation:** Easily run and modify using Python, making it accessible for users familiar with basic programming.



## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

You will need Python installed on your machine. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from python.org.

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Foundations-of-Computer-Simulation/tree/main/09-Game%20Of%20Life%20Simulation

```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Game-of-Life

```
**Running the Simulation:**
To run the Game of Life simulation:

```bash
python main.py

```

Follow the on-screen instructions to set initial configurations and modify the rules as needed.
## Usage
- Upon running main.py, the program will prompt you to set the initial state of the grid or load a predefined pattern. You can change the rules of the game at any stage before starting the simulation. The grid will update according to the rules you set, and you can observe how different configurations evolve over time.
